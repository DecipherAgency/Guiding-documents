Software is magick. 

Good magick frees you. It gives you power and knowledge.

Black magick uses you. It keeps control away from you. It exploits you and turns you into nothing beyond a consumer.

Magick will transform the world over the coming years. Will it be good magick or black magick? Whichever is more popular.

Decipher is a swarm of designers and marketers who aim to make ethical software more popular. 

Ethical software is anything that makes its user more powerful, rather than bringing them under the thumb of a corporate or government master. This includes – 
  Free and open-source software
  Good cryptography
  Cryptocurrencies
  Blockchain technology
  Software (like IPFS) that decentralizes the web
  Software (like Colony) that facilitates non-hierarchical organizing

We recognize there is a problem with ethical software – it is often harder to use, less popular, or uglier than its black magick competitors. 

We aim to solve this problem with services including 
  Design – for websites, and for graphical user interfaces
  Branding
  Internet marketing
  Copywriting
  Video
  Social Media
  Public Relations

We think this mission is important enough to deserve our best work.
