Anyone can join these platforms and participate in our mission. There is no vetting process and no barrier to entry.

We believe in voluntarism. Do what you feel motivated to do.

But that will get damned messy if you don't document it properly. Don't do anything without putting it on Trello. It's better to not do something than to do it and not document it.

Use Trello to keep track of tasks. Everything you're doing should ccorrespond to a Trello card.

If you're interested in a task, add yourself as a 'Member' to its Trello card. 

The voluntarist, horizontal swarm is built around a thin skeleton of central control. Conor & Tristan control the cryptocurrency accounts and have the authorization to edit the website. They can reward agents financially.
